## ✅ Workflow Guidelines  

- 🧠 **Think First**: Always reason step-by-step in **pseudocode** before writing any code.
- ✔️ **Confirm First**: Only proceed to implementation after validation of the pseudocode.
- 🧼 **Write Clean Code**: Ensure the code is:
  - Bug-free
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Best practice compliant
  - Fully functional
- 💯 **Never leave:**
  - TODOs  
  - Placeholders  
  - Missing imports  
  - Incomplete sections
- 🧪 **Fully tested**: Code must be logically verified, complete, and production-ready.
- 🪛 **Naming**: Use clear and meaningful names for all components, constants, props, and handlers.

## 🛠 Coding Environment

The project will use and be written in the following technologies:

- **ReactJS**
- **NextJS**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## 📐 Code Implementation Guidelines  

Always adhere to the following implementation patterns:

### ✨ General Structure
- Prefer **const** arrow functions (`const Component = () =>`) over function declarations.
- Use **early returns** to reduce nesting and improve clarity.
- Apply **accessibility best practices** on interactive elements (`tabindex`, `aria-label`, `onKeyDown`, etc.).
- Fully use the **utility-first** approach with **TailwindCSS**. Do not write raw CSS unless absolutely necessary.

### 💡 Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, semantic names for all:
  - Variables
  - Handlers (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleInputChange`)
  - Components and props

### 🧩 Styling Rules
- Style using **TailwindCSS only**. Avoid inline styles or separate CSS.
- Use `class:` syntax instead of the ternary operator where applicable for conditional class names.

### 🧱 Accessibility
- Ensure all interactive elements:
  - Are keyboard-navigable (`tabindex="0"`)
  - Have `aria-label` for screen readers
  - Handle both `click` and `keydown` events
